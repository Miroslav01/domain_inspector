TO DO List

- Tell Copilot to remember the current state BEFORE we start working on the new improvements

- In the beggining the logic shold made a check if the input is a domain name or an IP and then IF
it is a domain name it proceeds with DNS, WHOIS and CURL. 

- Subcase IF it is a subdomain 

- IF it is an IP some still DNS, WHOIS and CURL but some checks are NOT made !!!


- good python and coding practices
- add comments !!! in all of the files, the .py and the .html files - DONE 

- import AI Model to generate possible replays

In DNS Panel

- If there is more than one IP as output in A rec - DONE
- If there is more that one IP in www - DONE

- DNS propagation check; Check against Google DNS and agains OpenDNS, maybe against Cloudflare DNS

In WHOIS

- Some margin between Registrar and Nameservers - DONE
- check if the NS records and Nameservers are correct. Warning if they are different
- add raw output as clickable arrow - DONE

In CURL

- Check for various Headers
  Set-Cookie
  Security
  Cache

In Analysis

- If there is NO MX record => point output
- If there is NO SPF => point out
- In case there is IPv6 and the domain is pointed towards SG
- In case there is DNSSEC and the domain is using SG nameservers or pointed by A records
- In case there are 4 IPs => SG CDN
- Existing HTTP Coockie-Set Header => no dynamic Cache
- Check for Security Headers

- check if Cloudflare, Sucuri, BunnyCDN, SiteGround and other popular providers
- check can be via IP or via HTTP header returned


IN THE FUTURE

- separate check for Email related DNS records
- check for CNAME
- show the visitors IP, location, provider and UA
- check for the domain TLD - .it, .de, .bg ... 
- check for the IP, whois of the IP, owner, location, etc.
